*** BACULAADMON PlayBook ***
 
BaculaAdmon playbook 'baculaAdmon.yml' is able to manage bacula service configuration (backups of servers files) for all servers running bacula service, in a centralized way. Playbook can update changes at once for all bacula servers, but It can also update just one with '--limit serverName' parameter. It checks config files syntax before restart service with updates. In case of syntax error, it undoes updates and doesn't restart service. 

Updates are copied to server by a template located in 'roles/baculaAdmon/templates/etc/bacula/bacula-dir.conf.Centos.j2'. This template is the Bacula Director config file for all servers. But every job are generated automatically by a number of global variables: 'baculaAdmonFilesets', 'baculaAdmonGlobal', 'baculaAdmonGroup' and 'baculaAdmonHost'. Template's variables modifies file, customizing for every server.

Variables are defined by default in 'group_vars/all/baculaAdmon' file. We can overwrite values with groups or hosts files, but it's not a common case because global variables let us to define specific values for groups and hosts.


Command-line execution: 'ansible-playbook baculaAdmon.yml'

Scope: Playbook will update all server of 'baculaAdmon' group (in inventory)

Templates: 

  * 'roles/baculaAdmon/templates/etc/bacula/bacula-dir.conf.j2' 

  * 'roles/baculaAdmon/templates/etc/bacula/bacula-sd.conf.j2' 

Variables: 

  * 'baculaAdmonFilesets' -> Fileset configuration in bacula-dir.conf file. This variable is a list with the following atributes:

    - compression: Kind of compression used in Fileset (string format). This is an optional attibute. 'GZIP' by default value if not included.

    - signature: Kind of signature used in Fileset (string format). This is an optional attribute. 'MD5' by default value if not included.

    - name: Fileset name used by other variables to run backup jobs

    - includes: Fileset included directories List

    - excludes: Fileset excluded directories List (they should be a 'includes list' subset). This is an optional attribute. No excludes by default 


    Example:

      baculaAdmonFilesets:
      - name: "etc"
        includes: [ "/etc" ]


  * 'baculaAdmonGlobal' -> Clients and jobs configuration in bacula-dir.conf file for all servers. This variable is a list with the following atributes:

    - label: This is the item key. If we want to reference an item List (to delete or overwrite), we'll do using this attribute.

    - fileset: Fileset name ('name' attribute of 'baculaAdmonFileset' variable) used to backup jobs (string format)

    Both attributes are required. If any of them are not defined, this item will be ignored.


    Example:

      baculaAdmonGlobal:
      - label: "etc"
        fileset: "etc"


  * 'baculaAdmonGroup' -> Clients and jobs configuration for a specific group. It has two attributes:

    - group: Group name (in inventory)
  
    - backup: A list of backup jobs to apply, with the same attributes and meaning than 'baculaAdmonGlobal' variable (label and fileset)

      At this point, we can delete or overwrite global items, this way:

        * Overwrite global items -> Defining label attribute with same string than global item, and the rest of attributes with values we want for this case

        * Delete global items -> Defining label attribute with same string than global item, and nothing more (we must not define the rest of attributes)


      The rest of items defined (with label different than global items) will be added to config file after global items. 
    
    
    Example:

      baculaAdmonGroup:
      - group: mysql
        backup:
        - label: "root.scripts"
          fileset: "root.scripts"


  * 'baculaAdmonHost' -> Clients and jobs configuration for a specific server. It has two attributes:

    - host: Server name (in inventory)

    - backup: A list of backup jobs to apply, with the same attributes and meaning than 'baculaAdmonGlobal' variable (label and fileset)

      At this point, we can delete or overwrite global or groups items, this way:

        * Overwrite global or groups items -> Defining label attribute with same string than global or groups item, and the rest of attributes with values we want for this case

        * Delete global or groups items -> Defining label attribute with same string than global or groups item, and nothing more (we must not define the rest of attributes)


      The rest of items defined (with label different than global and groups items) will be added to config file after global and groups items.


    Example:

      baculaAdmonHost:
      - host: version
        backup:
        - label: "svn"
          fileset: "svn"
