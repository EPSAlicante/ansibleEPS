    To configure Linux/Unix hosts as nodes (hosts accessed by Ansible Host).

    First 'remote user' is asked (user to access hosts and execute commands).

    Then 'Hostname or IP' is asked (host to become a node)

    Finally will be tried a SSH connection to host as 'root'. If connection is done, the 'remote user' selected will be created, Ansible Host will be able to access with 'remote user' without password (using authorized_keys) and sudo will be installed and configured to permit 'remote user' to execute every command with sudo.

    After configuration the conection with 'remote user' will be tested, showing an 'OK' or error message.

    ** Remember that 'node' has to be introduced manually in inventory file **

    Any change in hosts management (any configuration changed) will create a /var/log/ansibleEPS/changes.log', checked by this option too.

    First script ask to choice 'view errors or changes' :

    	* View summary or details. 'summary' will show just lines where errors were produced, and 'details' will show the whole file.
