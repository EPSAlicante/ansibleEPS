*** DHCP PlayBook ***

DHCP playbook 'dhcp.yml' is able to manage DHCP service configuration for all servers running DHCP service, in a centralized way. Playbook can update changes at once for all DHCP servers, but It can also update just one with '--limit serverName' parameter.  It checks config files syntax before restart service with updates. In case of syntax error, it undoes updates and doesn't restart service.

Updates are made modifying static files (in 'roles/dhcp/files/etc/dhcpd/' directory), because all DHCP files are identical for all DHCP servers.

In that directory there are a DHCP config file for every building: dhcpd-P1.conf, dhcpd-P2.conf, dhcpd-P4.conf, dhcpd-TV.conf, dhcpd-Elec.conf


Command-line execution: 'ansible-playbook dhcp.yml'

Scope: Playbook will update all dhcp servers.

Files: 'roles/dhcp/files/etc/dhcpd/*'
