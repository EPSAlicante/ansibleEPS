*** WRAPPERS PlayBook ***

Wrappers playbook 'wrappers.yml' is able to manage TCP Wrappers Security ('/etc/hosts.deny' and /etc/hosts.allow' files configuration) for all servers (except those belonging to 'nowrappers' group), in a centralized way. Playbook can update changes at once for all servers, but It can also update just a server or a group, with '--limit serverName' or '--limit groupName' parameters.
 
Changes will be generated using some variables (through two templates) to create '/etc/hosts.deny' and '/etc/hosts.allow' files for every server.

Variables are defined by default in 'group_vars/all/wrappers' file. We can overwrite values with groups or hosts files, but it's not a common case because global variables let us to define specific values for groups and hosts.


Command-line execution: 'ansible-playbook wrappers.yml'

Scope: Playbook will update all server except those belonging to 'nowrappers' group.

Templates:
 
  *'roles/wrappers/templates/etc/hosts.deny.j2'

  *'roles/wrappers/templates/etc/hosts.allow.j2'

Variables:

    * 'hostsAllowGlobal' -> '/etc/hosts.allow' file configuration for all servers

       This variable is a list of items to define rules in file with access permission for server and origin. Every item has three attributes:

       - label: This attribute play two roles, on the one side it will be a comment for rule, on the other side it will be the item key. If we want to reference an item List (to delete or overwrite), we'll do using this attribute.

       - services: Services List in string format. There's an exception to the rule: if value is set to 'hostname' string, playbook will update entry with server name ('inventory_hostname' ansible variable).

       - origins: Origins List (IPs, networks, terminals, etc.) in string format. There's an exception to the rule: if value is set to 'hostname' string, playbook will update entry with server name ('inventory_hostname' ansible variable).

     All attributes are required. If any of them are not defined, this item will be ignored


     Example:

       hostsAllowGlobal:
	- label: localhost and Admon subnet 172.20.40.0/24 (sshd access)
	  services: sshd
	  origins: 127.0.0.1 172.20.40.0/255.255.255.0
	- label: Bacula server and Admon subnet (hostname-fd access)
	  services: hostname-fd
	  origins: 127.0.0.1 172.20.40.0/255.255.255.0 172.20.3.30
	- label: Nagios servers (nrpe access)
	  services: nrpe
	  origins: 172.20.1.12 172.20.1.15


    * 'hostsAllowGroup' -> '/etc/hosts.allow' file configuration for a specific group. It has two attributes: 

      - group: Group name (in inventory)

      - rules: A list of rules in '/etc/hosts.allow' file, with the same attributes and meaning than 'hostsAllowGlobal' variable (label, services and origins)

      At this point, we can delete or overwrite global items, this way:

        * Overwrite global items -> Defining label attribute with same string than global item, and the rest of attributes with values we want for this case

        * Delete global items -> Defining label attribute with same string than global item, and nothing more (we must not define the rest of attributes)


      The rest of items defined (with label different than global items) will be added to config file after global items.


      Example:

        hostsAllowGroup:
	- group: bacula
	  rules:
	  - label: Admon subnet (mysqld access)
	    services: mysqld
	    origins: 127.0.0.1 172.20.40.0/255.255.255.0
	  - label: Total (hostname-dir access)
	    services: hostname-dir
	    origins: ALL
	  - label: Total (hostname-sd access)
	    services: hostname-sd
	    origins: ALL
	
	- group: LDAP
	  rules:
	  - label: Total (ldaps access)
	    services: ldaps
	    origins: ALL


    * 'hostsAllowHost' -> '/etc/hosts.allow' file configuration for a specific server. It has two attributes: 

      - host: Server name (in inventory)

      - rules: A list of rules in '/etc/hosts.allow' file, with the same attributes and meaning than 'hostsAllowGlobal' variable (label, services and origins)

      At this point, we can delete or overwrite global items, this way:

        * Overwrite global or groups items -> Defining label attribute with same string than global or groups item, and the rest of attributes with values we want for this case

        * Delete global or groups items -> Defining label attribute with same string than global or groups item, and nothing more (we must not define the rest of attributes)


      The rest of items defined (with label different than global and groups items) will be added to config file after global and groups items.


      Example:

        hostsAllowHost:
	- host: ansible_server
	  rules:
	  - label: localhost and Admon subnet 172.20.40.0/24 (sshd access)
	  - label: SysAdm access (172.20.40.100)
	    services: sshd
	    origins: 127.0.0.1 172.20.40.100


    * 'hostsDenyGlobal', 'hostsDenyGroup' and 'hostsDenyHost' -> '/etc/hosts.deny' file configuration for all servers, a specific group and a specific server, respectively.

      All three variables are identical to 'hostsAllowGlobal', 'hostsAllowGroup' and 'hostsAllowHost' respectively. The only difference between them is that rules (in case of 'hostsDeny*' variables) are for deny access instead of allow access.


      Examples:

        hostsDenyGlobal:
        - label: Deny ALL
          services: ALL
          origins: ALL
