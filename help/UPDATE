*** UPDATE PlayBook ***

Update playbook 'update.yml' is able to update Debian and CentOS families servers (servers with 'yum' or 'apt package managers) in a centralized way, updating all software required. Playbook can update all servers, but It can also update just a server or a group, with '--limit serverName' or '--limit groupName' parameters. 

Command-line execution: 'ansible-playbook update.yml'

Scope: Playbook will update all servers except those belonging to 'noupdate' group.

Labels: 'Centos' and 'Debian' labels can be used to filter update (only servers of this distribution will be updates)
