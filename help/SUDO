*** SUDO PlayBook ***

Sudo playbook 'sudo.yml' is able to manage '/etc/sudoers' file for all server (except those belonging to 'windows' and 'nosudo' group), in a centralized way. Playbook can update changes at once for all servers, but It can also update just a server or a group, with '--limit serverName' or '--limit groupName' parameters. It checks file syntax before updating. In case of syntax error, it undoes updates.

Changes will be generated using some variables (through a template) to create '/etc/sudoers' file for every server.

Variables are defined by default in 'group_vars/all/sudo' file. We can overwrite values with groups or hosts files, but it's not a common case because global variables let us to define specific values for groups and hosts.


Command-line execution: 'ansible-playbook sudo.yml'

Scope: Playbook will update all server except those belonging to 'windows' and 'nosudo' group.

Templates: 'roles/sudo/templates/etc/sudoers.j2'

Variables:

    * 'sudoOptions' -> Default options for '/etc/sudoers' file

      This variable is a list of items to define options in sudoers file. These options depend on Destibution and Version of Operating Systems, so they are defined in specific '/group_vars/files' as 'Centos-6', 'Debian-7', etc. 

      Example

        sudoOptions: 
        - Defaults !visiblepw 
        - Defaults always_set_home 
        - Defaults env_reset 
        - Defaults timestamp_timeout=5 
        - Defaults secure_path = /sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin


    * 'sudoGlobal' -> '/etc/sudoers' file configuraciÃ³n for all servers 

      It's a variable with four attributes, each one per each main declaration in a sudoers file: 'users', 'commands' 'runas' and 'privilieges'. 

      These attributes are list of items with atributes:

	- users: Users alias definition

          It's a list of attributes to define an user alias. Attributes are: name (alias name) and list (list of users names belonging to defined alias)

          This is a required attribute, even beeing an empty list -> users: []

        - commands: Commands alias definition

	  It's a list with the same atribute than 'users': name (alias name) and list (commands list). 

	  There are three options to define commands list:

	    * Direct commands -> Commands will be written as they will be used in host using sudo. Useful when this command only exists in this host (a specific script, for example)

	      Ex: /root/scripts/backup.sh all 

	    * Indirect commands -> These commands are not written directly. Every Operating System could have different names for the same command, so we use script 'scripts/path_facts.py' to get path and name of commands. This way, we use variables used by 'path_facts.py' as 'command.commandLabel' or 'daemon.daemonLabel.operation' depending on we are using commands or daemons.

	      If we need a command or daemon, and it doesn't exist in 'path_facts.py' script, first we'll have to add it to script to get path and name when script will be executed.

	      Ex: command.umount ('umount' has to be written in 'path_facts.py' too)

	      Ex: daemon.bind.restart ('bind' has to be written in 'path_facts.py')

	    * Indirect commands with specific arguments -> Using an indirect command and specifics arguments written directly

	      Ex: command.iptables -nvL ('iptables' has to be written in 'path_facts.py' too)

	  This is a required attribute, even beeing an empty list -> commands: []

        - runas: Runas users alias definition 

	  It's a list with the same attribute than 'users' and 'commands': name (runas alias name) and list (list of users).

	  This is an optional attribute


        - privileges: Privileges definition depending on defined alias 

	  It'a a list with five attributes to define privileges:
 
	    * 'name' -> label (used to overwrite privileges in group or host levels)

	    * 'user' -> field with an alias users defined (or users name directly)

	    * 'host' -> field with server with privileges. There's an exception to the rule: if value is set to 'hostname' string, playbook will update field with server name ('inventory_hostname' ansible variable).

	    * 'command' -> field with an alias commands defined (or commands directly)

	    * 'password' -> 'Yes' or 'No' dependig on sudo will ask for password or not


	  This is a required attribute


      Example:

        sudoGlobal:
         users:
         - name: ROOT
           list: [ admin, wwwadm ]
         
         - name: ADMIN
           list: [ manager, admin, wwwadm ]
         
         - name: NAGIOS
           list: [ nagios ]
         
         commands:
         - name: ADMIN
           list: [ command.shutdown, daemon.ssh.restart, daemon.network.restart, daemon.bacula-fd.restart, daemon.syslog.restart, daemon.nrpe.restart, daemon.nscd.restart, daemon.munin-node.restart, daemon.ossec.restart ]
         
         - name: NAGIOS
           list: [ daemon.bacula-fd.stop, daemon.bacula-fd.start, daemon.nscd.stop, daemon.nscd.start, daemon.munin-node.stop, daemon.munin-node.start, daemon.ossec.stop, daemon.ossec.start, command.iptables-nL ]
         
         privileges:
         - name: ROOT global
	   user: ROOT
           host: hostname
           command: ALL
           password: Yes
         
         - name: ADMIN global
	   user: ADMIN
           host: hostname
           command: ADMIN
           password: No
         
         - name: NAGIOS global
	   user: NAGIOS
           host: hostname
           command: NAGIOS
           password: No
         
         - name: ansible global
	   user: ansible
           host: hostname
           command: ALL
           password: No


    * 'sudoGroup' -> '/etc/sudoers' file configuration for a specific group. It has five attributes:

      - group: Group name (in inventory)

      The rest ('users', 'commands', 'runas' and 'privileges') are the same list of attributes and meaning than 'sudoGlobal' variable

      Defining these last four attributes (all of them are list of items), we have three options:

        * Empty List (if it's a required attribute) -> In this case we don't need more items than we inherit from the same attribute on 'sudoGlobal' variable

	* New items (different name field) -> In this case we'll get items inherits from the same attribute on 'sudoGlobal' variable, adding these new items

	* Overwrite items (equal name field) -> In this case we'll change values of items inherits from the same attribute on 'sudoGlobal' variable with new values


      Example:

        sudoGroup:
	- group: qmail
	  users:
	  - name: GROUP_WWW_QMAIL
	    list: [ www-data ]
	
	  commands:
	  - name: GROUP_ADMIN_QMAIL
	    list: [ daemon.apache.restart, daemon.qmail.restart, daemon.qmail-smtp-auth.restart, daemon.dovecot.restart, command.qmail-qstat ]
	
	  - name: GROUP_WWW_QMAIL
	    list: [ command.quota -v * ]
	
	  privileges:
	  - name: ADMIN, NAGIOS qmail group
	    user: ADMIN, NAGIOS
	    host: hostname
	    command: GROUP_ADMIN_QMAIL
	    password: No
	
	  - name: GROUP_WWW_QMAIL qmail group
	    user: GROUP_WWW_QMAIL
	    host: hostname
	    command: GROUP_WWW_QMAIL
        	    
        - group: ...


    * 'sudoHost' -> '/etc/sudoers' file configuration for a specific server. It has five attributes: 

      - host: Server name (in inventory)

      The rest ('users', 'commands', 'runas' and 'privileges') are the same list of attributes and meaning than 'sudoGlobal' and 'sudoGroup' variables

      Defining these last four attributes (all of them are list of items), we have three options:

        * Empty List (if it's a required attribute) -> In this case we don't need more items than we inherit from the same attribute on 'sudoGlobal' and 'sudoGroup' variables

        * New items (different name field) -> In this case we'll get items inherits from the same attribute on 'sudoGlobal' and 'sudoGroup' variables, adding these new items

        * Overwrite items (equal name field) -> In this case we'll change values of items inherits from the same attribute on 'sudoGlobal' or 'sudoGroup' variables  with new values


      Example:

        sudoHost:
	- host: ansible_server
	  users:
	  # ADMIN overwrited global value
	  - name: ADMIN
	    list: [ manager, admin, wwwadm ]
	
	  - name: HOST_DHCP
	    list: [ manager, admin, wwwadm ]
	
	  commands:
	  - name: HOST_DHCP
	    list: [ 'command.ansible-playbook -i /etc/ansibleEPS/eps /etc/ansibleEPS/dhcp.yml -t ??', command.joe /etc/ansibleEPS/roles/dhcp/files/etc/dhcp/dhcpd-??.conf' ]
	
	  privileges:
	  - name: HOST_DHCP ansible_server host
	    user: HOST_DHCP
	    host: hostname
	    command: HOST_DHCP
	    password: No

	- host: ...
