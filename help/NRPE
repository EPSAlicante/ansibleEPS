*** NRPE PlayBook ***

NRPE playbook 'nrpe.yml' is able to manage Nagios NRPE checks for all servers (except those belonging to 'windows' and 'nonrpe' group), in a centralized way. Playbook can update changes at once for all servers, but It can also update just a server or a group, with '--limit serverName' or '--limit groupName' parameters.

First playbook create is '/etc/nagios/nrpe.d' directory if it doesn't exist.

Then it adds 'include' directive to created directory, in '/etc/nagios/nrpe.cfg' config file.

Then creates '/etc/nagios/nrpe.d/baseNrpe.cfg' file with all NRPE checks inside ('command' lines).

It also comments all defined checks in '/etc/nagios/nrpe.cfg' config file.

Finally it will restart Nagios NRPE service if any change happens.

Changes will be generated using some variables (through a template) to create '/etc/nagios/nrpe.d/baseNrpe.cfg' checks file for every server.

Variables are defined by default in 'group_vars/all/nrpe' file. We can overwrite values with groups or hosts files, but it's not a common case because global variables let us to define specific values for groups and hosts.


Command-line execution: 'ansible-playbook nrpe.yml'

Scope: Playbook will update all servers except those belonging to 'windows' and 'nonrpe' group

Templates: 'roles/nrpe/templates/etc/nagios/nrpe.d/baseNrpe.cfg.j2'

Variables:

    * 'nrpeGlobal' -> 'baseNrpe.cfg' file configuration with NRPE checks for all servers

      This variable is a list of items to define entries in file, with NRPE label and command to check. Every item has two attributes:

      - label: This attribute play two roles, on the one side it will be the label of NRPE check, on the other side it will be the item key. If we want to reference an item List (to delete or overwrite), we'll do using this attribute.

      - command: Plugin to execute and its arguments (string format). Could be a text with command or 'indirect commands'. In this case, commands are not written directly. Every Operating System could have different names for the same command, so we use script 'scripts/path_facts.py' to get path and name of commands. This way, we use variables used by 'path_facts.py' as 'command.commandLabel' or 'daemon.daemonLabel.operation' depending on we are using commands or daemons (Ex. 'command.umount' or 'daemon.bind.restart'). If we need a command or a daemon, and it doesn't exist in 'path_facts.py' script, first we'll have to add it to script to get path and name when script will be executed.

       Both attributes are required. If any of them are not defined, this item will be ignored.

      Examples:

        nrpeGlobal:
        - label: check_load
          command: /usr/lib/nagios/plugins/check_load -w 15,10,5 -c 30,25,20
        - label: check_memory
          command: /usr/lib/nagios/plugins/check_mem.sh -w 90 -c 95
        - label: check_diskRoot
          command: /usr/lib/nagios/plugins/check_disk -w 20% -c 10% -p /


    * 'nrpeGroup' -> 'baseNrpe.cfg' file configuration with NRPE checks for a specific group. It has two attributes:

      - group: Group name (in inventory)

      - rules: A list of entries in NRPE file, with the same attributes and meaning than 'nrpeGlobal' variable (label and command)

      At this point, we can delete or overwrite global items, this way:

        * Overwrite global items -> Defining label attribute with same string than global item, and the rest of attributes with values we want for this case

        * Delete global items -> Defining label attribute with same string than global item, and nothing more (we must not define the rest of attributes)


      The rest of items defined (with label different than global items) will be added to config file after global items.


      Example:

        nrpeGroup:
	- group: DHCP
	  rules:
	  - label: check_dhcp
	    command: "/usr/lib/nagios/plugins/check_procs -w 1: -c 1: -a 'dhcpd' -u dhcpd"
	  - label: restart-dhcp
	    command: sudo daemon.dhcp.stop > /dev/null 2> /dev/null;sudo daemon.dhcp.start
	
	- group: DNS
	  rules:
	  - label: check_dns
	    command: /usr/lib/nagios/plugins/check_dns -H server_11 -s 127.0.0.1 -a 172.20.1.11 -t 5
	  - label: restart-dns
	    command: sudo daemon.bind.stop > /dev/null 2> /dev/null;sudo daemon.bind.start


    * 'nrpeHost' -> 'baseNrpe.cfg' file configuration with NRPE checks for a specific server. It has two attributes:

      - host: Server name (in inventory)

      - rules: A list of entries in NRPE file, with the same attributes and meaning than 'nrpeGlobal' variable (label and command)

      At this point, we can delete or overwrite global or groups items, this way:

        * Overwrite global or groups items -> Defining label attribute with same string than global or groups item, and the rest of attributes with values we want for this case

        * Delete global or groups items -> Defining label attribute with same string than global or groups item, and nothing more (we must not define the rest of attributes)


      The rest of items defined (with label different than global and groups items) will be added to config file after global and groups items.


      Example:

        nrpeHost:
        - host: server_12 
          rules:
          - label: check_tempP1
            command: /usr/lib/nagios/plugins/check_ipmi -w 25 -c 30
