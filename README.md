##What's ansibleEPS?

AnsibleEPS is a **collection of [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com) playbooks** to manage Linux/Unix hosts of your network.

Management permits in a centralized way: **software management** (install, update, delete), **services** (start, stop, configure), **users** (add, modify, delete), **security**, and much more.

##What can I do with AnsibleEPS?

Especifically, ansibleEPS does the following tasks:

| Task | Details |
|-------------|------------------------------|
| **Common** management for all hosts (installation, configuration and checking) |  ● Locales ● Groups and users ● Repositories ● Concurrency ● Services to disable ● /etc/resolv.conf file ● Nscd service ● Securetty ● Global profile variables ● Nvi editor ● Utilities (extra software) ● Munin-node client ● Nrpe client ● Ldap Authentication with PAM ● Syslog service ● Sshd service ● Ntp service ● Bacula client ● Ossec client |
| **Hosts file (/etc/hosts)** management for all hosts (configuration and checking) | Three level configuration: ● Global, to apply on all hosts ● Group, to apply on all hosts belonging to group selected ● Host, to apply on host selected |
| **Sudo file (/etc/sudoers)** management for all hosts (installation, configuration and checking) | Three level configuration: ● Global, to apply on all hosts ● Group, to apply on all hosts belonging to group selected ● Host, to apply on host selected |
| **TCP Wrappers (/etc/hosts.allow & /etc/hosts.deny files)** management for all hosts (configuration and checking) | Three level configuration: ● Global, to apply on all hosts ● Group, to apply on all hosts belonging to group selected ● Host, to apply on host selected |
| **PAM Access (/etc/security/access.conf file)** management for all  hosts (installation, configuration and checking) | Three level configuration: ● Global, to apply on all hosts ● Group, to apply on all hosts belonging to group selected ● Host, to apply on host selected |
| **NRPE** management for all hosts (installation, configuration and checking) | Three level configuration: ● Global, to apply on all hosts ● Group, to apply on all hosts belonging to group selected ● Host, to apply on host selected |
| **IPTables** management for all hosts (configuration and checking) | Three level configuration: ● Global, to apply on all hosts ● Group, to apply on all hosts belonging to group selected ● Host, to apply on host selected |
| **Crontab** managemenet for all hosts (configuration and checking) | Three level configuration: ● Global, to apply on all hosts ● Group, to apply on all hosts belonging to group selected ● Host, to apply on host selected |
| **Proxmox servers** management (configuration and checking) | Configuration of Proxmox servers |
| **Bacula servers** management (configuration and checking) | Configuration of Bacula servers |
| **DHCP servers** management (configuration and checking) | Configuration of DHCP servers |
| **Munin servers** management (configuration and checking) | Configuration of Munin servers |
| **Nagios servers** management (configuration and checking) | Configuration of Nagios servers |
| Email addresses list of QMail server | Addresss list generation of Qmail server |


##How does it work?

Management can be done in **two ways** (we can use both):

(A) **Direct Mode**, using the **Admin Menu**, and selecting preferred option and arguments as: host to be managed, group of hosts to be managed, or any other argument required.

This way, we can manage anything for a host, a group or all hosts, just selecting option and arguments.

(B) **Scheduled Mode**, we can select time (usually at night) to execute all managements for all hosts. This way we'll be sure that next morning every feature of every host will be correctly configured.

All changes made and errors produced will be saved in log files to be watched next morning.


##Installation & Configuration

We have to install and prepare system to be ready for management. There are some step to do:

###Installation

1. Copy tgz package **'ansibleEPS.tgz'** and installation script **'install.py'** (located in **install** directory) in a directory on a CentOS 6 host (this will be our 'Ansible Server').

2. Execute **'install.py'** script to install 'AnsibleEPS'.

###Configuration

1. First of all, we have to **configure a host as node**. What's a node?

 A node is a host directly SSH accessed by Ansible server (host where Ansible was installed) with a predefined user and no password.

 By default, user predefined connecting to nodes is 'ansible', but we can change it modifying 'ansible_ssh_user' variable in '/etc/ansibleEPS/group_vars/all/all' main configuration file.

 To convert a host as node, simply select 'add node' option in **admin menu** '/etc/ansibleEPS/menu.py'. Select 'user to connect' and hostname or IP. The script will try to connect by SSH to host as 'root' (we have to type password), then it will create 'user to connect' and 'authorized_keys' file with 'Ansible server' public key, also it will install 'sudo' package and configure 'sudoers' file permitting execute everything to 'user to connect'.

2. Second step: **add nodes to inventory**

   Inventory file is '/etc/ansibleEPS/eps'. Nodes are introduced to inventory inside groups.

   Ansible Documentation at: [http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_inventory.html#inventory](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_inventory.html#inventory)

3. **Modify Admin variables**. Every data we need to manage nodes are located at:

      - '/etc/ansibleEPS/group_vars/all' directory, with global data to manage nodes
 
      - '/etc/ansibleEPS/group_vars' directory, with group-level data to manage nodes

      - '/etc/ansibleEPS/host_vars' directory, with host-level data to manage nodes

      >Example: In 'all' configuration file exists a variable 'nameserver' with IPs of DNS servers for all nodes. It can be different for a group of hosts (a group called 'remote', defined at inventory with nodes inside), then DNS server has to change, so we have to create a file '/etc/ansibleEPS/group_vars/remote' and define 'nameserver' variable inside with different values. The same way, DNS servers can be different for a specific node (called 'special'), so we have to create a file '/etc/ansibleEPS/host_vars/special' and define 'nameserver' variable inside with other values.

4. **Execute playbooks** from Admin menu '/etc/ansibleEPS/menu.py'


##Does it work for all Operating System?

Most playbooks need to install specific software on nodes. By default playbooks work with **'yum'** and **'apt'** package managers. To add new package managers, it's necessary to modify playbooks code.

System is ready to work with the following Operating Systems (all of them with 'yum' or 'apt' package manager):

  - CentOS 6

  - Debian 4

  - Debian 6
  
  - Debian 7

  - Debian 8

  - Ubuntu 14

There’s a specific file for every Operating System and version in '/etc/ansibleEPS/group_vars' directory. They include variables and specific values. For example: specific users, repositories, software, configuration files, etc.

Adding a new Operating System and Version (based on 'yum' or 'apt' package manager) is very simple: just create a new file in '/etc/ansibleEPS/group_vars' directory with name 'OperatingSystem-Version' and fill it with variables and specific values (easier copying other similar file and modifying values).

>Example: To prepare system for RedHat 7 nodes, we can copy 'CentOS-6' file (the most similar) to 'RedHat-7', verifying values and changing if necessary.
